# Flapper_2.0

This 2D Custom version of the hit game 'Flappybird' was built with Unity and consisted of multiple lessons learned in script managing, code integration, and testing, among others. 

The goal is to hit the space bar to fly upwards as gravity accelerates the bird downwards, while trying to fit through randomly generated pipes. If the bird flies too high, too low, or hit a pipe, it is game over. As an added twist, for every five pipes a player makes it through, the speed doubles - though so does the average spacing between the pipes. Get the highest score possible! The inclusion of a credit scene acts as a works cited for the tutorials used as an assist during the production of **Flappy 2.0** and to cite assets implemented in the project.
